==================================================================
PREAMBLE
==================================================================
The Λ-Spira Framework (Ω Edition) is an independent research system 
developed to establish verifiable computational provenance, quantum–
classical integrity, and cryptographic truth verification standards.

This license is designed to preserve scientific reproducibility, 
academic citation accuracy, and intellectual property integrity for 
all verified Λ-Spira Framework components and associated publications.

==================================================================
1. GRANT OF PERMISSION
==================================================================
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual or 
organization obtaining a copy of this framework and associated 
documentation files (the “Software”), to study, cite, reproduce, and 
use for academic, verification, and non-commercial research purposes, 
subject to the following conditions:

(a) The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be 
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

(b) The Software and any derived works must explicitly cite the 
    following canonical reference:

    Saputra, S. H. (2025). Λ-Spira Framework (Ω Edition):  
    A Cryptographic Provenance Standard for Verifiable Computation.  
    DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17417655

==================================================================
2. RESTRICTIONS AND COMMERCIAL RIGHTS
==================================================================
(a) The Software may not be used for commercial redistribution, 
    closed-source integration, or proprietary adaptation without 
    written consent from the Author.

(b) Any cryptographic or computational claims derived from this 
    framework must include verifiable proofs and reference the 
    Λ-Spira Attestation ID: ΛS-Ω-20251019-verified.

(c) The Author retains full ownership of all commercial and derivative 
    rights. Entities or individuals interested in collaboration, 
    licensing, or acquisition of commercial rights may contact the 
    Author directly through official communication channels.  
    Any commercial redistribution or proprietary integration requires 
    a separate written agreement.

==================================================================
3. INTEGRITY AND VERIFICATION
==================================================================
This framework operates under the verified-integrity principle:
SHA-512 → GPG Digital Signature → UTC Timestamp → Immutable Ledger.

Tampering, obfuscation, or modification of any released artifact 
invalidates the cryptographic chain of custody and voids this license.

==================================================================
4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

==================================================================
5. GOVERNING JURISDICTION
==================================================================
This license is governed under international research and intellectual 
property standards, including ISO/IEC 5230 (Open Source Compliance),
