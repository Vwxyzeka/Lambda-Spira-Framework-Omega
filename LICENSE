==================================================================
PREAMBLE
==================================================================
The Λ-Spira Framework (Ω Edition) is an independent research system 
developed to establish verifiable computational provenance, quantum–
classical integrity, and cryptographic truth verification standards.

This license preserves scientific reproducibility, academic citation 
accuracy, and intellectual-property integrity for all verified Λ-Spira 
Framework components and associated publications.

==================================================================
1. GRANT OF PERMISSION
==================================================================
Permission is granted, free of charge, to any individual or organization
obtaining a copy of this framework and associated documentation files 
(the “Software”), to study, cite, reproduce, and use for academic, 
verification, and non-commercial research purposes, subject to:

(a) This copyright and permission notice must appear in all copies 
    or substantial portions of the Software.

(b) All derived works must explicitly cite the following canonical 
    references:

    A Cryptographic Provenance Standard for Verifiable Computation.

==================================================================
2. RESTRICTIONS AND COMMERCIAL RIGHTS
==================================================================
(a) The Software may not be used for commercial redistribution, 
    closed-source integration, or proprietary adaptation without 
    written consent from the Author.

(b) Any cryptographic or computational claims derived from this 
    framework must include verifiable proofs and reference the 
    Λ-Spira Attestation ID: ΛS-Ω-20251019-verified.

(c) The Author retains full ownership of all commercial and 
    derivative rights. Entities or individuals seeking collaboration, 
    licensing, or acquisition of commercial rights must enter a 
    separate written agreement with the Author.

==================================================================
3. INTEGRITY AND VERIFICATION
==================================================================
This framework operates under the verified-integrity principle:
SHA-512 → GPG Digital Signature → UTC Timestamp → Immutable Ledger.

Tampering or modification of any released artifact invalidates the 
cryptographic chain of custody and voids this license.

5. GOVERNING JURISDICTION
==================================================================
Governed under international research and intellectual-property 
standards including ISO/IEC 5230 (Open Source Compliance), 
ISO/IEC 23026 (Software Engineering Documentation), and ISO/IEC 9796-3
