### Abstract
Î›-Spira defines a verifiable cryptographic method for proving the **existence, origin, and integrity** of computational processes.  
Built entirely within an offline macOS hybrid node using Qiskit 1.2.4 and GPG 2.4.3, it produces **immutable, mathematically verifiable records** of computation without any external infrastructure.

Each computation becomes a timestamped and signed fact â€” a measurable unit of *computational truth*.

### Verified Artifacts
- `WHITEPAPER_LAMBDA_SPIRA_Î©-1.0_20251019_VERIFIED.pdf`
- `Î›-Spira_Ledger_Entry_Î©_20251019.txt` + `.sig`
- `Spira_QPU_Package_Î©_20251019_FINAL.zip` + `.sha512`
- `README_RELEASE.txt` (Integrity Record)

All artifacts are stored under append-only policy and cryptographically cross-signed with the operator key.
